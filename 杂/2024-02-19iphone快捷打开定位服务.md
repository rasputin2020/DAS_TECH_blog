## note3  
For me what worked was App-Prefs:Privacy&amp;path=LOCATION root= is no longer needed apparently (iOS 16.4.1, year 2023)  (https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/85172)  

## note4  
in iOS 15, it's now "Location Services" and I haven't been able to type space, so the shortcut, can only open "Privacy" and not go inside "Location Services"  
Running iOS 15.1. Steps: 1) Open Shortcuts 2) Tap +. 3) Set shortcut name. 4) Tap Add Action. 5) Find and select Open URL. 6) Input prefs:root=Privacy&path=LOCATION as URL. 7) Tap Play icon in bottom right corner -> Location Services opens as expected. 8) Tap menu icon in top right corner and then Add to Home screen. 9) Go to home screen and tap created shortcut -> nothing happens  (https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/373605/iphone-shortcut-to-turn-location-services-on-off)
